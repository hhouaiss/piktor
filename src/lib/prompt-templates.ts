  WALL_MOUNTED_ENFORCEMENT: `üö® CRITICAL WALL-MOUNTED SAFETY REQUIREMENT: This furniture piece MUST remain securely attached to the wall using {MOUNTING_SYSTEM} with {HARDWARE_SPEC} grade commercial installation hardware. NEVER show floor contact, legs touching ground, free-standing placement, or detached positioning. Maintain proper wall-mounted positioning with minimum 2-inch clearance from floor surface. Wall mounting hardware must be visible and appropriate for commercial installations, showing proper attachment points and structural integrity. This is a SAFETY-CRITICAL requirement for commercial furniture specifications.`,

  WALL_MOUNTED_DESK_SPECIFIC: `üè¢ CRITICAL WALL-MOUNTED DESK POSITIONING SPECIFICATION: This wall-mounted desk MUST be positioned at exactly 75cm (29.5 inches) from the floor to the desktop surface, which is the standard height for wall-mounted workspace furniture. The desk MUST appear suspended from the wall with NO legs, supports, or contact with the floor. Show visible heavy-duty wall mounting brackets or French cleat system appropriate for supporting desk loads (50-100kg capacity). The desk should appear to "float" above the floor with clear space underneath. Position as if installed in a commercial office environment at ergonomic standing desk height. This is CRITICAL for wall-mounted desk functionality and user safety.`,

  WALL_MOUNTED_HEIGHT_ENFORCEMENT: `üìê MANDATORY HEIGHT POSITIONING: Wall-mounted furniture must be positioned at industry-standard installation heights: Wall-mounted desks at 75cm from floor to surface, wall shelves at appropriate intervals based on function, wall cabinets with proper clearance above counter surfaces. Height positioning must reflect realistic commercial installation practices and ergonomic requirements. Show appropriate wall clearance and mounting hardware suitable for the specified installation height and furniture load requirements.`,

  MATERIAL_FIDELITY: `üîç ENTERPRISE MATERIAL ACCURACY REQUIREMENT: Maintain EXACT material specifications - {MATERIAL_LIST} with authentic surface textures, grain patterns, finish characteristics, and reflectance properties. Color fidelity must match {COLOR_SPECIFICATION} with precise undertones, highlighting, and shadow characteristics. Material authenticity is critical for enterprise furniture catalog accuracy. Surface properties must reflect realistic material behavior including wear patterns, natural variations, and aging characteristics appropriate for commercial furniture grade materials.`,

  COMMERCIAL_QUALITY: `‚≠ê COMMERCIAL PHOTOGRAPHY STANDARDS ENFORCEMENT: Professional furniture photography quality meeting enterprise furniture catalog standards, suitable for high-end commercial marketing materials, luxury retail applications, and premium brand representation. Absolutely NO consumer-grade photography aesthetics, amateur lighting, or low-quality presentation. Photography must meet commercial furniture industry professional standards for color accuracy, detail resolution, and brand prestige representation.`,

  NO_TEXT_POLICY: `üö´ ABSOLUTE TEXT EXCLUSION ENFORCEMENT: Zero tolerance for any text, labels, captions, watermarks, logos, product numbers, model identifiers, brand marks, or written content within the image. Image must be completely clean and suitable for text overlay integration by professional design teams. Any visible text will result in rejection of the generated image. This includes reflective text, shadows of text, or partial text visibility.`,

  FURNITURE_SPECIFIC: `üè¢ ENTERPRISE FURNITURE INDUSTRY COMPLIANCE: Product must conform to commercial furniture industry standards with accurate proportions meeting furniture industry specifications, professional construction details showing commercial-grade quality, and enterprise-grade quality indicators visible in the photography. No unrealistic interpretations, consumer-grade appearances, or non-commercial furniture aesthetics. Construction details must reflect actual commercial furniture manufacturing standards and quality expectations.`,

  DESK_TYPE_RECOGNITION: `üíº DESK TYPE IDENTIFICATION AND POSITIONING: Clearly distinguish between desk types and their appropriate positioning: Wall-mounted desks MUST be mounted to wall at 75cm height with no floor contact, Standing desks show adjustable legs with floor contact, Traditional desks show four legs with floor contact, Floating desks show wall-mounted with hidden brackets. The AI must recognize the specific desk type from the reference image and maintain that exact mounting/positioning configuration. Wall-mounted desks require specific mounting hardware visibility and proper installation height demonstration.`,

  CONTEXTUAL_INTEGRITY: `üéØ CONTEXT PRESERVATION REQUIREMENT: Maintain exact contextual requirements for {CONTEXT_TYPE} without deviation. Context-specific lighting, composition, and environmental requirements are mandatory and must be followed precisely. Any deviation from specified context parameters will compromise commercial furniture presentation standards.`,

  DIMENSIONAL_ACCURACY: `üìè DIMENSIONAL PRECISION REQUIREMENT: Maintain accurate proportional relationships and dimensional characteristics appropriate for specified furniture type. All proportional elements must reflect realistic commercial furniture dimensions and scaling. No distorted proportions, unrealistic scaling, or dimensionally impossible configurations.`
