  COMPREHENSIVE_ANALYSIS: `You are analyzing furniture product images for a commercial furniture company. Your analysis will drive AI image generation for enterprise clients who require professional-grade results.

üéØ CRITICAL MISSION: This analysis feeds GPT-image-1 and FLUX text-to-image models. Since these models cannot see reference images, your descriptions must be EXTRAORDINARILY DETAILED and use PROFESSIONAL FURNITURE TERMINOLOGY.

üìã FURNITURE INDUSTRY REQUIREMENTS:
- Use precise furniture trade terminology (e.g., "executive task chair" not "office chair")
- Specify construction methods (mortise-and-tenon, welded frame, etc.)
- Include commercial-grade specifications
- Reference industry-standard materials and finishes
- Identify support and mounting systems for proper placement
- Note ergonomic and functional features

  INTELLIGENT_PLACEMENT: `üè† INTELLIGENT FURNITURE PLACEMENT: Position this furniture according to its intended placement type and design characteristics. Wall-mounted pieces should show appropriate mounting hardware and no floor contact. Floor-standing pieces should show proper floor contact and realistic room placement. Follow professional interior design principles for the specific furniture category.`,

  ERGONOMIC_POSITIONING: `üíª ERGONOMIC FURNITURE POSITIONING: Position furniture at appropriate heights and orientations for intended use. Desks at standard working heights, seating at proper ergonomic positions, storage at accessible levels. Show realistic clearances for functionality and access.`,

  REALISTIC_SUPPORT_SYSTEMS: `üîß AUTHENTIC SUPPORT DISPLAY: Show appropriate support systems for each furniture type. Wall-mounted items display mounting hardware, floor-standing items show base or leg contact, table-top items positioned on suitable surfaces. Hardware and supports should match the furniture's weight and intended use.`,

  MATERIAL_FIDELITY: `üîç ENTERPRISE MATERIAL ACCURACY REQUIREMENT: Maintain EXACT material specifications - {MATERIAL_LIST} with authentic surface textures, grain patterns, finish characteristics, and reflectance properties. Color fidelity must match {COLOR_SPECIFICATION} with precise undertones, highlighting, and shadow characteristics. Material authenticity is critical for enterprise furniture catalog accuracy. Surface properties must reflect realistic material behavior including wear patterns, natural variations, and aging characteristics appropriate for commercial furniture grade materials.`,

  COMMERCIAL_QUALITY: `‚≠ê COMMERCIAL PHOTOGRAPHY STANDARDS ENFORCEMENT: Professional furniture photography quality meeting enterprise furniture catalog standards, suitable for high-end commercial marketing materials, luxury retail applications, and premium brand representation. Absolutely NO consumer-grade photography aesthetics, amateur lighting, or low-quality presentation. Photography must meet commercial furniture industry professional standards for color accuracy, detail resolution, and brand prestige representation.`,

  NO_TEXT_POLICY: `üö´ ABSOLUTE TEXT EXCLUSION ENFORCEMENT: Zero tolerance for any text, labels, captions, watermarks, logos, product numbers, model identifiers, brand marks, or written content within the image. Image must be completely clean and suitable for text overlay integration by professional design teams. Any visible text will result in rejection of the generated image. This includes reflective text, shadows of text, or partial text visibility.`,

  FURNITURE_SPECIFIC: `üè¢ ENTERPRISE FURNITURE INDUSTRY COMPLIANCE: Product must conform to commercial furniture industry standards with accurate proportions meeting furniture industry specifications, professional construction details showing commercial-grade quality, and enterprise-grade quality indicators visible in the photography. No unrealistic interpretations, consumer-grade appearances, or non-commercial furniture aesthetics. Construction details must reflect actual commercial furniture manufacturing standards and quality expectations.`,

  DESK_TYPE_RECOGNITION: `üíº DESK TYPE IDENTIFICATION AND POSITIONING: Clearly distinguish between desk types and their appropriate positioning: Wall-mounted desks MUST be mounted to wall at 75cm height with no floor contact, Standing desks show adjustable legs with floor contact, Traditional desks show four legs with floor contact, Floating desks show wall-mounted with hidden brackets. The AI must recognize the specific desk type from the reference image and maintain that exact mounting/positioning configuration. Wall-mounted desks require specific mounting hardware visibility and proper installation height demonstration.`,

  CONTEXTUAL_INTEGRITY: `üéØ CONTEXT PRESERVATION REQUIREMENT: Maintain exact contextual requirements for {CONTEXT_TYPE} without deviation. Context-specific lighting, composition, and environmental requirements are mandatory and must be followed precisely. Any deviation from specified context parameters will compromise commercial furniture presentation standards.`,

  DIMENSIONAL_ACCURACY: `üìè DIMENSIONAL PRECISION REQUIREMENT: Maintain accurate proportional relationships and dimensional characteristics appropriate for specified furniture type. All proportional elements must reflect realistic commercial furniture dimensions and scaling. No distorted proportions, unrealistic scaling, or dimensionally impossible configurations.`
