## üîß Advanced Configuration Examples

### Strict Mode vs. Creative Mode

**Strict Mode** (strictMode: true):
```text
‚Ä¢ STRICT MODE ACTIVE - EXACT FIDELITY REQUIRED:
  - Zero creative interpretation of product design
  - Exact color matching to specified materials
  - Precise dimensional relationships as specified
  - No stylistic modifications or artistic interpretation
```

**Creative Mode** (strictMode: false):
- Allows subtle creative interpretation
- More flexible with styling and presentation
- Maintains product accuracy but allows artistic license

### Reserved Text Zones

**Hero with Right Text Zone**:
```text
‚Ä¢ Reserved Text Zone: Keep right area clear for text overlay
‚Ä¢ Strategic negative space reserved for text overlay integration in right zones
‚Ä¢ NO text or graphics in the image itself
```

**Text Zone Mapping**:
- `left`: Left third reserved for text
- `right`: Right third reserved for text  
- `top`: Upper portion reserved for text
- `bottom`: Lower portion reserved for text

### Props Integration

**With Props** (`props: ['plant', 'lamp', 'rug']`):
```text
‚Ä¢ Approved Props: plant, lamp, rug
‚Ä¢ Environmental context that elevates furniture appeal while maintaining clear product focus
```

**No Props** (`props: []`):
```text
‚Ä¢ Props: none (clean focus on product)
‚Ä¢ Minimal distractions - furniture as exclusive focus
```

## üö® Common Issues and Solutions

### Issue: Incorrect Placement Detection
**Problem**: Floor-standing furniture detected as wall-mounted
**Solution**: Use more specific product type keywords
```typescript
// Instead of:
productType: "desk"

// Use:
productType: "standing desk" // or "floor desk"
```

### Issue: Poor Material Representation  
**Problem**: Materials not rendering correctly
**Solution**: Use specific material descriptors
```typescript
// Instead of:
materials: "wood"

// Use: 
materials: "solid oak wood, natural grain, matte finish"
```

### Issue: Wrong Context Optimization
**Problem**: Output not optimized for intended use
**Solution**: Match context preset to actual usage
```typescript
// For e-commerce listings:
contextPreset: 'packshot'

// For website headers:
contextPreset: 'hero'

// For social media:
contextPreset: 'instagram' // or 'story'
```

## üîÑ Integration Patterns

### Basic Integration
```typescript
// Simple prompt generation
const prompt = generateGeminiPrompt(specs, contextPreset, settings);

// Use with Gemini API
const response = await generateImageWithGemini({ prompt, aspectRatio });
```

### Advanced Integration with Metadata
```typescript
// Get full intelligence data
const result = generateGeminiPromptWithMetadata(specs, contextPreset, settings);

// Log intelligence for debugging
console.log('Product Intelligence:', result.metadata.productIntelligence);
console.log('Applied Constraints:', result.metadata.constraintsApplied);

// Use with multimodal generation
if (referenceImages.length > 0) {
  const variations = await generateMultipleImagesWithReferences(
    result.prompt,
    referenceImages,
    variationCount,
    contextPreset
  );
}
```

### Validation and Debugging
```typescript
import { validateGeminiPrompt } from '@/lib/gemini-prompt-engine';

const validation = validateGeminiPrompt(result.prompt);
if (!validation.isValid) {
  console.error('Prompt issues:', validation.issues);
  console.log('Recommendations:', validation.recommendations);
}
```
