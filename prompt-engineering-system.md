# Comprehensive Prompt Engineering System for Image Editing with Google Gemini 2.5 Flash Image

## System Overview

This prompt engineering system is designed to transform furniture/product packshot images into various marketing assets while maintaining product integrity and achieving professional photography quality results.

## Core Principles

### 1. Hyper-Specific Descriptions
- Use precise measurements, materials, and spatial relationships
- Include specific lighting conditions and camera angles
- Define exact positioning and proportions

### 2. Context and Intent Preservation
- Clearly state the marketing purpose of each transformation
- Maintain brand consistency across all asset types
- Preserve the original product's key characteristics

### 3. Semantic Positive Prompts
- Focus on what we want to achieve rather than what to avoid
- Use constructive language that guides the AI toward desired outcomes
- Build upon existing elements rather than negating them

### 4. Photographic Terminology
- Employ professional camera and lighting terminology
- Specify lens types, focal lengths, and depth of field
- Use industry-standard composition rules

### 5. Iterative Refinement Framework
- Progressive enhancement system for continuous improvement
- Specific refinement prompts for common adjustments
- Quality control checkpoints

## Template Categories

**Purpose**: Show products in real-world, lived-in environments
**Target Markets**: Home decor, interior design inspiration
**Key Elements**: Natural settings, contextual props, ambient lighting

#### Base Template - Living Room Scene
```
Using the provided packshot image, seamlessly integrate this [PRODUCT_TYPE] into a beautifully styled modern living room setting. 

PRODUCT PRESERVATION:
- Keep the exact product dimensions, proportions, and design details unchanged
- Maintain the original product's color accuracy and material textures
- Preserve all product features, hardware, and finishing details

ENVIRONMENT CREATION:
- Place the product naturally within a contemporary living room with warm, inviting atmosphere
- Include complementary furniture pieces: a plush sectional sofa in neutral tones, a glass coffee table with books and a ceramic vase, textured throw pillows, and a soft area rug
- Add contextual elements: potted plants (monstera or fiddle leaf fig), warm table lamps with soft yellow light, framed artwork on walls
- Create depth with layered lighting: natural window light from the left side, warm ambient table lamps, subtle ceiling lighting

PHOTOGRAPHIC SPECIFICATIONS:
- Shot with a 35mm lens equivalent for natural perspective
- Aperture f/5.6 for balanced depth of field, keeping the product in sharp focus while allowing slight background softness
- Soft, natural lighting mimicking golden hour indoor illumination
- Three-quarter angle composition showing both the product and room context
- Maintain professional interior photography standards with balanced exposure

STYLE REQUIREMENTS:
- High-end interior design magazine aesthetic
- Color palette of warm neutrals, creams, and earth tones
- Clean, uncluttered composition that draws eye to the product
- Natural shadows and realistic light falloff
```

#### Refinement Prompts for Lifestyle Images
```
LIGHTING ADJUSTMENT:
"Enhance the natural lighting in this scene by adding softer window light from the right side, creating gentle shadows that add dimension without overpowering the product. Maintain the warm, golden-hour ambiance while ensuring the product remains the focal point."

COMPOSITION REFINEMENT:
"Adjust the camera angle to a slightly lower perspective, shooting at furniture height level. This should create a more intimate, human-scale view while maintaining clear visibility of the product's design details and proportions."

CONTEXTUAL ENHANCEMENT:
"Add subtle lifestyle elements that suggest recent use: an open book on the coffee table, a throw blanket casually draped over the sofa arm, and a half-full coffee cup on a side table. These elements should feel natural and lived-in without cluttering the scene."
```

### B. Ad Images
**Purpose**: Commercial promotional content with strong visual impact
**Target Markets**: E-commerce, advertising campaigns, catalogs
**Key Elements**: Clean backgrounds, dramatic lighting, product focus

#### Base Template - Hero Product Shot
```
Transform this packshot image into a premium advertising photograph that emphasizes the product's luxury and craftsmanship.

PRODUCT ENHANCEMENT:
- Maintain exact product specifications, dimensions, and all design elements
- Enhance material textures to showcase quality: bring out wood grain patterns, fabric weaves, metal finishes
- Preserve authentic color representation while optimizing for maximum visual impact

BACKGROUND CREATION:
- Create a sophisticated gradient background transitioning from deep charcoal gray at the bottom to lighter gray at the top
- Ensure the background remains completely neutral and non-competitive with the product
- Maintain subtle texture variation in the background to add depth without distraction

LIGHTING DESIGN:
- Implement professional studio lighting setup: key light at 45-degree angle from upper left, creating defined but soft shadows
- Add rim lighting from the back right to separate the product from background and highlight edges
- Use fill light to reduce shadow depth and maintain detail visibility in all product areas
- Create subtle reflections on any glossy surfaces without causing harsh glare

PHOTOGRAPHIC EXECUTION:
- Shot with 85mm lens equivalent for minimal distortion and natural proportions
- Aperture f/8 for maximum product sharpness while maintaining background separation
- Professional studio photography standards with perfect exposure balance
- Centered composition with generous white space for text overlay capability

```

#### Ad Image Variants

##### Minimalist Clean Background
```
Create an ultra-clean advertising image with pure white seamless background. Position the product with dramatic side lighting that creates a single, well-defined shadow extending to the right. The lighting should be bright and even, eliminating all color casts while maintaining rich product colors. Shot with medium format camera aesthetic, 80mm lens, f/11 aperture for maximum sharpness throughout.
```

##### Dramatic Mood Lighting
```
Transform into a moody, premium advertising shot with dark, sophisticated atmosphere. Use dramatic chiaroscuro lighting with strong contrast between light and shadow. Single powerful light source from upper left creates bold shadows while maintaining all product detail visibility. Background should be rich, deep black with subtle gradation. Shot with 50mm lens, f/4 for slight background separation while keeping product perfectly sharp.
```

## Refinement System

### Progressive Enhancement Workflow

#### Stage 1: Initial Generation
Use base templates with core requirements

#### Stage 2: Quality Assessment
```
ASSESSMENT PROMPT:
"Evaluate this generated image for: 1) Product accuracy and proportion maintenance, 2) Lighting quality and realism, 3) Compositional strength, 4) Material texture authenticity, 5) Overall professional photography standards. Identify the single most important improvement needed."
```

#### Stage 3: Targeted Refinement
Apply specific refinement prompts based on assessment

#### Common Refinement Prompts

##### Lighting Adjustments
```
"Enhance the lighting in this image by softening harsh shadows while maintaining definition. Add subtle fill lighting to brighten shadow areas without eliminating them completely. Ensure the product remains the brightest element in the composition with natural light falloff."
```

##### Composition Improvements  
```
"Refine the composition by adjusting the product placement to better follow the rule of thirds. Ensure adequate negative space around the product while maintaining its prominence. Improve the visual balance between the product and environmental elements."
```

##### Material Enhancement
```
"Enhance the material textures to better showcase the product's quality and craftsmanship. Increase the visibility of [wood grain/fabric weave/metal finish] details while maintaining realistic appearance. Ensure all material surfaces respond appropriately to the lighting conditions."
```

##### Background Optimization
```
"Optimize the background to better complement the product without competing for attention. Ensure sufficient contrast for product separation while maintaining the intended mood and style. Adjust background elements to support rather than distract from the main subject."
```
